## Purpose

Think of it as virtual JupyterCon. It’s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-community-calls/668/107).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make community announcements (without a need for discussion).

* Jupyter Community Building working group (JCB) update: A [PR](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/329) has been opened to formalize the merge between the DEI Standing Committee and the JCB (previously tracked in an [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/293)).

- Jupyter AI v3.0 update: TLDR: March 31st 2026! Support for AI agents like Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Goose, Kiro and more... see here: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai/issues/1531

## Agenda Items

Add agenda items here **before** the meeting. The event host will reorganize the agenda so that it fits in the 60m meeting slot.

* Martin Renou. Presenting Notebook.link: Run, share, and collaborate on Jupyter notebooks with zero setup. Instant scientific computing for everyone, just a link away.
* Darshan Paudyal. Sharing progress on two Jupyter CFP projects: [eslint-plugin-jupyter](https://github.com/Darshan808/eslint-plugin-jupyter) and [jupyter-builder](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-builder)
* Prasun Anand : Presenting [Zasper](https://github.com/zasper-io/zasper), A High-Performance, Go-Powered Alternative to Jupyter Server
* Mike Krassowski: Progress on improving visual regression testing in Jupyter (2 minute update)
* Tony: updates on importing notebook with `importnb`: [github](https://github.com/deathbeds/importnb), [PR 162](https://github.com/deathbeds/importnb/pull/162), [readthedocs](https://importnb--162.org.readthedocs.build/en/162/lite/lab/index.html?path=__init__.ipynb)
